"""AVBD 3D rigid-body solver (6-DOF).

Sibling of the particle Solver in `solver.py`. Each body now has full SE(3)
state: position (vec3) + orientation (quat) + linear velocity (vec3) +
angular velocity (vec3) + mass + body-local inverse inertia tensor.

Constraint pool follows the same per-row pattern as the 3-DOF solver but
with per-side **body-local** anchor offsets so the contact / pin point
rotates with the body each iteration. Per-body primal solve is a 6×6
SPD system (kernels solve via Schur-complement of 3×3 blocks).

MVP scope:
  - Bodies: rigid box (with rotation).
  - Constraints: FLOOR_CONTACT_6DOF per body corner + CONTACT_TANGENT_6DOF
    friction rows + PIN_6DOF (3 axis rows per pin).
  - No body-body contact yet (next iteration; needs OBB-OBB SAT).
