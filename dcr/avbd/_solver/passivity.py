"""Native-path passive-energy clamp (Stage X1).

Enforces the follow-up's core inequality (foundation §15) on the NATIVE modal
constraint, per rigid substep and globally:

    ΔE_modal(substep)  ≤  η · ΔE_rigid_loss(substep)          (η = 1 ⇒ passive)
    Σ ΔE_modal_injected ≤ η · Σ ΔE_rigid_loss + ε_tol         (cumulative)

where ΔE_modal is the change in modal MECHANICAL energy E_m = ½q̇ᵀM_qq̇ + ½qᵀK_qq
this substep, and ΔE_rigid_loss is the drop in total rigid kinetic energy over the
same substep. The support can only ring on energy the rigid bodies actually lost —
the "moving support can only transfer work explicitly present in its reservoir"
invariant (`avbd_native_dcr_followup_spec_v2.md` §27).

Enforcement (foundation §6 quadratic α-cap, mirroring the reference
`dcr/dcr/dcr_world.py:_bound_dcr_velocities`): the modal velocity q̇ⁿ⁺¹ committed by
the stepper is scaled by α ∈ [0,1] so the substep's modal-energy gain fits the
budget. It is INERT (α = 1) whenever the step does not inject — i.e. whenever the
real ring gain already fits under η·(rigid loss) — so the safe-region ring
(PAPER_CONFIG, 16×4) is untouched and the clamp only bites where the un-clamped
solver injects (e.g. XPBD at 8×2).

# DEVIATION (foundation §15 is velocity-level): only q̇ is scaled, not the position
# q (which was co-solved inside the constraint and would need a re-solve to rescale).
# The elastic PE ½qᵀK_qq is therefore not re-clamped; the ledger tracks the FULL
# E_m = KE+PE and the accompanying test asserts the total inequality still holds
# (the injection pathology is a q̇ blow-up, so the velocity clamp addresses it — but
# see PassivityLedger.max_violation for the residual PE contribution).

CPU host path only: the symplectic modal step this rides on is itself host-only
(`solver_6dof.py` guards device+symplectic), so no device kernel is touched.
